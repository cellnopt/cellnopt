:Description: a 2-time point model/data set used in several articles and for testing cellnopt steady states. 
:Model: the file **PKN-ToyMMB_T2.sif** is a model similar to ToyMMB. It contains an inhibitor from cJun to Jnk.
:Data: The accompanying data **MD-ToyMMB_T2.csv** was generated by Camille Terfve for the CellNOptR tutorial.
