:Description: A variant of **ToyPB** with a self loop on **ph** species used in the reference here below.
:Model: The network **PKN-ToyPB_SBML.sif** is extracted from the SBML-qual model provided in the paper
    and encoded in **PKN-ToyPB_SBML.xml** . This is variant of **PKN-ToyPB_True.sif**.
:Data: There is no data provided but one could use the data used in **ToyPB** that 
    was generated from **ToyPB_True** model and a set of ODE parameters.

Here is a representation of the model
