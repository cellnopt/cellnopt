:Description: A variant of **ToyPB** with a self loop on **ph** species
:Model: The PKN network **PKN-ToyPB_SBML.sif** is made of the content of the SBMLqual
    Model.xml used in the reference below. This is almost the same model as 
    :ref:`PKN-ToyPB_True.sif` except for an additional self-loop added on **ph** node.
:Data: There is no data provided but one could use the data used in :ref:`ToyPB` that 
was generated from **ToyPB_True** model (same except for the self-loop).


Here is a representation of the ToyPB model (with the data).

- The model in SBML-qual format is also available **PKN-ToyPB_SBML.xml**
