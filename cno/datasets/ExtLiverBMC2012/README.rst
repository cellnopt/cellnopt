:Description:  **ExtLiverBMC2012** derives from :ref:`ExtLiverPCB`. The data is the same so no
new data file is provided. The PKN model is slightly different (See below).
:Model: The model to be used **PKN-ExtLiverBMC2012.sif**. Note, However, that the directory 
also contains **PKN-ExtLiverMSBmodUP.sif**, which has the same topology but names are UniProt identifiers. 
:Data:
    **MD-ExtLiverBMC2012.csv** is exactly the same file as **MD-ExtLiverPCB.csv**. It is normalised.

.. warning:: Note that they are a few variants of this data/PKN.
