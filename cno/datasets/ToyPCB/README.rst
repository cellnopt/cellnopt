:Description: This model is used in the references here below.
    The network was generated manually from the paper. The data was generated
    manually from the matlab data in the CNO matlab repository
    (Data/SampleData/ToyModelPCB). Experiments with stimuli set to zero (all NA)
    were removed.
:Data: The data in MIDAS format is **MD-ToyPCB.csv**.
