:Description: This model comes from the reference here below. 
:Model: The SIF file was generated from the **reactions** file found on CNA website (Tcell data from 2007
published in Plos Computational biology,  Aug 2007 Saez et al.). The
generation was performed using cno.io.CNA class that converts the reaction to 
SIF file called TCellPCB2007.sif. 
:Data: **MD-TCellPCB2007.csv**
