:Description: This model comes from the reference here below. The SIF file was generated
from the **reactions** file found on CNA website (Tcell data from 2007
published in Plos Computational biology,  Aug 2007 Saez et al.). The
generation was performed using read_reactions.py that converts the reaction to 
SIF file called TCellPCB2007.sif.
