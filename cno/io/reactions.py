class Reaction(ReactionBase):
    """Logical Reaction

    A Reaction can encode logical ANDs and ORs as well as NOT::

        >>> from cno import Reaction
        >>> r = Reaction("A+B=C") # a OR reaction
        >>> r = Reaction("A^B=C") # an AND reaction
        >>> r = Reaction("A&B=C") # an AND reaction
        >>> r = Reaction("C=D")   # an activation
        >>> r = Reaction("!D=E")  # a NOT reaction

    The syntax is as follows:

    #. The **!** sign indicates a logical NOT.
    #. The **+** sign indicates a logical OR.
    #. The **=** sign indicates a relation (edge).
    #. The **^** or **&** signs indicate a logical AND. Note that **&** signs
       will be replaced by **^**.


    Internally, reactions are checked for validity (e.g., !=C is invalid).

    You can reset the name::

        >>> r.name = "A+B+C=D"

    or create an instance from another instance::

        >>> newr = Reaction(r)

    Sorting can be done inplace (default) or not. ::

        >>> r = Reaction("F+D^!B+!A=Z")
        >>> r.sort(inplace=False)
        '!A+!B^D+F=Z'

    Simple operator (e.g., equality) are available. The equality will sort the species
    internally so equality should be done on the instance (not the attribute :attr:`name`)::

        >>> r = Reaction("F+D^!B+!A=Z")
        >>> r.name == '!A+!B^D+F=Z'
        False
        >>> r == '!A+!B^D+F=Z'
        True

    If a reaction **A+A=B** is provided, it can be simplified by calling :meth:`simplify`.
    ANDs operator are not simplified. More sophisticated simplifications using Truth
    Table could be used but will not be implemented in this class for now.
