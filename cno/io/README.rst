Description
################

This directory contains utilities to manipulate networks of proteins as logical models and data in MIDAS format, which can be used to store perturbations data (e.g., phosphorylation). More generally, it contains tools for Input/Output manipulations.

The main data structures are provided with the **midas** directory (XMIDAS), **sif** directory (SIF format from cytoscape) and, **cnograph** module, which provide a data structure to manipulate hte logical models with the data (CNOGraph). 

See `cno documentation <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cno>`_ for full details.
