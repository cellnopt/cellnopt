Graph/model comparison

One common thread that runs though many of the examples in the previous section is the need to be able t
o compare two graphs and somehow assess their similarity. Certainly, what one means by 'similarity' is
particular  to the application; there are many kinds of similarities
one may be interested in between two graphs. A first list of such similarity questions might include:

    * Are these graphs identical copies of each other?
    * How many changes must I make to one graph to change it into the other?
    * Do each of these graphs contain an identical     subgraph? How large is this subgraph
      Can we contain both of these graph in a single larger graph? How small can this graph be?
    * If we allow the graph to change over time, can we assess whether two graphs were generated from th
e same set of evolutionary rules from a common ancestor graph?
    * How much does the neighborhood of  a given node in one graph
     look like the neighborhood of     a given
     node in another     graph? Can we compare the neighborhoods
     of edges?
     
Each of these questions corresponds to a distinct similarity
     notion. Indeed, having many different notions
     of similarity
     available allows a researcher to select the most appropriate
     measure for his or her application.
     There exists an array of answers
     for each of these questions, many of which will be discussed
     in Chapter
